The below values will be updated during the tutorial. These represent the render region as fractions of the background width and height.

```min_x = 0.24589478969573975```
```min_y = 0.21553641557693481```
```max_x = 0.5874119997024536```
```max_y = 0.761963963508606```

Use these to set the dial component bounds in JUCE.
